I used intellij IDE to create the project.

Intellij created the directory for me which contains compiled files.

Here are the instructions to run the program:
=============================================
- go to dir which contains the main class: DataEntryProject\out\production\DataEntryProject
- as it has compiled java files, can be run the main class (UserFormBuilder.class) by following command:
    java UserFormBuilder
